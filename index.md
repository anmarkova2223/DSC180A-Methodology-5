## Questions
- What is the most intersting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
	- **The most interesting thing we discussed this quarter is brain connectivity. Trying to map a network of brain regions that are connected.**
- Describe potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
	- **For Quarter 2 I would love to use the brain activation networks to predict movement. For example being able to identify deifferent networks from the brain activation data when performing an simple task. Ideally, our model given the data would be able to show causation or association of different brain regions for a given activity.**
- What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 project?
	- **First of all we would need different data, we would need task related data. Secondly, I think the difference in my approach would primarily be that I would focus on simple models to identify association rather than investigate complex methods from previous research papers.**
- What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
	- **Currently we are relying on correlations to show association. However, I think it would also be interesting to explore causal models, such as granger causality. I also think it would be interesting to investigate how can we make connections between more than two regions, but rahter investigate associations between multiple regions at once.**
